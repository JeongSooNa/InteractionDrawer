# InteractionDrawer
InteractionDrawer is a JavaScript library for the fully automatic drawing of highly interactive 2D
ligand interaction diagrams.
Calculated interactions (hydrogen bonds, cation-pi interactions, pi-stackings, ionic interactions,
and metal interactions) of the ligand with nucleic acids, amino acids, and metals are depicted as 
colored dashed lines. Hydrophobic contacts are visualized by labeled green splines.
A web application based on this library can be found at https://proteins.plus/ (PoseEdit).
